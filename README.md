## Welcome to the WP-Leads Github repository

WP-Leads seamlessly integrates the Wordpress registration and comment forms with MailChimp, Constant Contact, and SalesForce.com

While the documentation for the [WP-Leads plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-leads-mailchimp-constant-contact-and-salesforcecom-integration/) can be found at WordPress.org Plugin Directory, here you can browse the source of the project, find and discuss open issues and, even [contribute yourself](https://github.com/michael-cannon/wp-leads-mailchimp-constant-contact-and-salesforcecom-integration/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Installation

Here's a [guide on how to install WP-Leads in your WordPress site](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-leads-mailchimp-constant-contact-and-salesforcecom-integration/installation/). If you want to run the Git version though, you have two options:

* You can clone the GitHub repository: https://github.com/michael-cannon/wp-leads-mailchimp-constant-contact-and-salesforcecom-integration.git
* Download it directly as a ZIP file: https://github.com/michael-cannon/wp-leads-mailchimp-constant-contact-and-salesforcecom-integration/archive/master.zip

This will download the latest development version of WP-Leads by Michael Cannon. While this version is usually stable, it is not recommended for use in a production environment.
